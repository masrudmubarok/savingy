## Installation and How to Run the Application

### Frontend (Vue.js 3)

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  Install dependencies using pnpm:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  Configure the environment (if necessary). Typically, API URLs are configured in a `.env` file or within JavaScript configuration files. Ensure the Axios `baseURL` in your `main.js` points to the correct backend API address.

4.  Run the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```

    The frontend application will be accessible at `http://localhost:<port>` (usually 5173 or another available port).

### Backend (Laravel 12)

1.  Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  Install backend dependencies using Composer:
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3.  Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure your database details and other environment variables.

4.  Generate the application key:
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

5.  Run database migrations:
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

6.  Start the backend development server:
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

    The backend API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.
